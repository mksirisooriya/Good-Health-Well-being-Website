                        especially
                        from lung cancer and coronary heart disease, may be prevented, not all illnesses and diseases
                        can be
                        prevented. Several behavioral patterns have been linked in scientific investigations to severe
                        sickness and
                        premature mortality. The purpose of this pamphlet is to assist you in making behavioral changes
                        and
                        improving your health so that you and your family can live longer, healthier lives.

                        aspect of being healthy. It also concerns social, mental, and physical wellbeing. The goal of

                        feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. It also influences how we respond to stress, interact with
                        people, and
                        make wise decisions.1. Every stage of life, from infancy and adolescence to maturity, is
                        critical

                        Both physical and mental well-being are crucial aspects of total health. Depression, for
                        instance,

                        disease,
                        and stroke. In a similar vein, having long-term medical issues might raise your chance of mental
